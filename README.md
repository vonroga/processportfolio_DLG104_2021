# Process Portfolio | Ryan Paranich | DGL104 2021

Process portfolio for DGL104, 2021, App Dev Foundations. Note to self: Students must complete at least 2 activities each week.

## Part 1

### Activity 0101

Due Jan 19

"Consider a recent programming project (perhaps from last semester) in which you either didn't know the answer to a problem, or you couldn't figure out how to solve a development issue you were facing. Revisit that code now, with fresh eyes, and reconsider the problem: Can you articulate exactly why this was a problem before? Is the solution any more evident? Use your README.md file to explain what the problem was and describe the strategies and resources you could use to solve it."

In CPS100 the one concept that really threw me for a loop at first was recursion. It took thinking about and looking at examples before it fully clicked. It's a visualization problem, ultimately. If you can't visualize what the code is doing it becomes really hard to look at and understand, and recursive thinking doesn't always come naturally when I look at problems and solutions.

I also really love the ternary operator for adding clarity in my code. It almost seems like a more simplified way of doing if statements that should have been taught at the begining of CPS100, not the end. I've used it alot in some of my final projects/assignments and on my exams. While we didn't really get a decent opportunity to look at others code and conduct a functional code review, I've often shared in study sessions how the operator can reshape someone's code for improed simplicity and readability.

For the sake of GitHub Markdown practice, here are a few examples of code I shared in one of my last study sessions of the term:

```
char id = boolVal ? 'A' : 'B';
```

```
System.out.println(
    "The value is " +
    val > 10 ? "greater " : "not greater " +
    "than 10."
    );
```

### Activity 1012

Due Jan 19

"Consider a recent programming project (perhaps from last semester). Open up the code and examine it for readability (as defined in the reading from Seriously Good Software). Use your README.md file to describe at least three potential areas of improvement, as per the reading from Serious Good Software."

You know, I might be a bit bias, but I write some pretty neat and organized code. I wish we did more code reviews with our peers so that we could really get an understanding of where we might be able to really improve the readability for others.

I write detailed and descriptive comments. I organize my imports, properties, and methods. In general, I like the way this old project is structured.

Something I only started doing on my final exam was using the @ prefixes to help with intellisense when calling a method in external class code. As an example, by using @param I can define a quick tip that pertains to that specific parameter. I expect I'll be doing more of this in term 2 to improve the readability and enhancement of my code. I love organization!
