## Part 1

### Activity 0101

Due Jan 19

Adapted from The Pragmatic Programmer (pg. 5):

Consider a recent programming project (perhaps from last semester) in which you either didn't know the answer to a problem, or you couldn't figure out how to solve a development issue you were facing. Revisit that code now, with fresh eyes, and reconsider the problem: Can you articulate exactly why this was a problem before? Is the solution any more evident? Use your README.md file to explain what the problem was and describe the strategies and resources you could use to solve it.

### Activity 1012

Due Jan 19

Consider a recent programming project (perhaps from last semester). Open up the code and examine it for readability (as defined in the reading from Seriously Good Software). Use your README.md file to describe at least three potential areas of improvement, as per the reading from Serious Good Software.
