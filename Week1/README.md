In CPS100 the one concept that really threw me for a loop at when I was first introduced to it was recursion. It took thinking about and looking at examples before it fully clicked. It's a visualization problem, ultimately. If you can't visualize what the code is doing it becomes really hard to look at and understand, and recursive thinking doesn't always come naturally when I look at problems and solutions.

I also really love the ternary operator for adding clarity in my code. It almost seems like a more simplified way of doing if statements that should have been taught at the begining of CPS100, not the end. I've used it alot in some of my final projects/assignments and on my exams. While we didn't really get a decent opportunity to look at others code and conduct a functional code review, I've often shared in study sessions how the operator can reshape someone's code for improed simplicity and readability.

For the sake of GitHub Markdown practice, here are a few examples of code I shared in one of my last study sessions of the term:

```
char id = boolVal ? 'A' : 'B';
```

```
System.out.println(
    "The value is " +
    val > 10 ? "greater " : "not greater " +
    "than 10."
    );
```

You know, I might be a bit bias, but I write some pretty neat and organized code. I wish we did more code reviews with our peers so that we could really get an understanding of where we might be able to really improve the readability for others.

I write detailed and descriptive comments. I organize my imports, properties, and methods. In general, I like the way this old project is structured.

Something I only started doing on my final exam was using the @ prefixes to help with intellisense when calling a method in external class code. As an example, by using @param I can define a quick tip that pertains to that specific parameter. I expect I'll be doing more of this in term 2 to improve the readability and enhancement of my code. I love organization!
